misclassification in multi‐species acoustic data when estimating
occupancy and relative activity</h3>
<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p>Motivated by bat surveys that employ autonomous recording units
(ARUs), the authors introduce a model capable of analyzing counts from
multiple species simultaneously while accounting for false-positive
detections that arise as a result of species misclassification. This
approach expands on previously developed false-positive models; the
authors use simulation to characterize model performance and to compare
the performance of their model to these existing models, all of which
use simplifying assumptions for analysis (e.g., counts summed to binary
or data only from a single focal species). The authors then apply to
count-detection model to bat ARU data from the Montana Natural Heritage
Program.</p>

misclassification with occupancy dynamics and encounter rates: A
semi-supervised, individual-level approach</h3>
<h4 id="summary-1">Summary</h4>
<p>The authors introduce a version of the count detection model proposed
by <span class="citation" data-cites="wright20">Wright et al. (<a
href="#ref-wright20" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> that
exchanges the multinomial likelihood for a categorical distribution and
models calls on an individual level. The authors also include elements
of a dynamic occupancy model with terms for colonization and extinction
and allow the confusion matrix to be rectangular to accommodate the
possibility of a morphospecies designation (which leads to more possible
species designations than species present). The authors fit the model to
carabid beetle data where the imperfect classifier is a parataxonomist;
they use these data to compare the performance of their model against a
reduced, classification-only model without reference to occupancy
dynamics. Finally, the authors conducted a simulation study similar to
ours (2 species and 3 classification categories) and found only modest
gains in performance as the level of validation effort increased.</p>

occupancy from autonomous recording unit data in the presence of
misclassifications and detection heterogeneity</h3>
<h4 id="summary-2">Summary</h4>
<p>The authors propose a two-species false-positive N-mixture model that
they claim accounts for misclassification and abundance-induced
detection heterogeneity when estimating occupancy from ARU data. The
model does not require manual verification of any recorded detections to
estimate occupancy and incorporates abundance as a latent variable in
both the state and detection components of the model. The authors
simulated data under the N-mixture model with a variety of scenarios for
<span class="math inline">\(\mu,\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(r,\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> parameters. The authors then
compared the performance of a) a reduced presence/absence model, b) the
count detection model, and c) the N-mixture model. Simulations resulted
in excellent performance (e.g., convergence, bias, RMSE, coverage) for
the N-mixture model and low convergence with some bias for the count
detection model. After simulations, the authors applied the model to
MYCI and MYYU bat data from two sites in Colorado, finding the N-mixture
model to produce more plausible estimates than either competitor
model.</p>

assessment on determining local presence of rare bat species</h3>
<h4 id="summary-3">Summary</h4>
<p>The authors critically examine the performance of the current
standard for the USFWS (“MLE-metric”) in determining the presence or
absence of rare species. This existing method, which uses the p-value
from a multinomial likelihood ratio test is contrasted with the count
detection model of <span class="citation" data-cites="wright20">Wright
et al. (<a href="#ref-wright20" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>
and two other false-positive occupancy models. Methods comparison is
based on a simulation study which varies the characteristics of the
classifier, assemblage and detection probability and is evaluated based
on the median correct decisions among sites. The authors found that the
count detection model outperformed existing methods: the remove approach
overestimated <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> and
underestimated <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> regardless of the
simulation settings, while the naive model overestimated both and most
often led to the correct decision about the true presence of a rare
species. The authors conclude by proposing that the count detection
model be used more widely to allow the integration of local, targeted
data with rangewide information and providing a possible framework for
predicting species occurrence.</p>
<h4 id="model-specification-2">Model specification</h4>
<p>For the MLE-metric, the multinomial likelihood is written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
L(\boldsymbol{n}, \theta) \propto \prod_k\left(\sum_{k&#39; = 1}^K
\phi_{kk&#39;}\theta_k^B \right)^{n_k}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{kk&#39;}\)</span> is the
(assumed known) probability that calls from species <span
class="math inline">\(k&#39;\)</span> are classified to species <span
class="math inline">\(k;\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(\theta_k^B\)</span> is the (unknown) relative
frequency of species <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> in the
sampled community; <span class="math inline">\(n_k\)</span> is the
number of calls assigned to species <span
class="math inline">\(k,\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the sum of <span
class="math inline">\(n_k\)</span> values, representing the total number
of calls recorded and assigned a species label. If a likelihood ratio
test (denoted as an “MLE-metric” by the authors; hypotheses of the test
are given in the notes section below) yields <span
class="math inline">\(p &lt; \alpha = 0.05,\)</span> the species is
determined to be present at the site visit and is recorded as a 1 in the
detection history that is modeled using an occupancy model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Z_i \sim Bernoulli(\psi_i) \\
Y_{ij} | Z_i \sim Bernoulli(Z_i \space p_{ij}).
\]</span></p>
<p>This is the “remove” model described by the authors; the “naive”
model does not have the preprocessing step to remove false positives by
applying the MLE-metric in the LRT. The final model-based approach that
is compared in the authors’ simulation study is the count detection
model <span class="citation" data-cites="wright20">(<a

misclassifications</h3>
<h4 id="summary-4">Summary</h4>
<p>The authors perform two simulation studies based on bat acoustic data
from British Columbia. The first of these compares a) the coupled
classification model, b) an uncoupled likelihood with auxiliary data and
c) an uncoupled classification likelihood with informative priors
instead of auxiliary data to inform the <span
class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span> matrix. For comparing a) and b),
the authors use three different prior specifications: uniform on
simplex, informative and reference distance. In the second simulation
study, the authors examine validation effort using the empirical bat
data. The authors find that the coupled classification model
outperformed the uncoupled model regardless of the prior structure. Of
the prior structures investigated, the reference distance prior
performed best for estimating the elements of the confusion matrix. In
the second simulation, none of the fitted models converged for the
lowest 4 validation scenarios; this appeared to be driven by the rarest
species receiving an insufficient number of calls. Credibility interval
width did not appear to be affected by the level of validation effort.
The authors conclude with a example analysis from the HM scenario, which
was the lowest level of effort where models consistently converged for
all parameters, and discuss the need for a quota sampling strategy for
validation, motivating our paper.</p>

Misclassification in Multispecies Distribution Models</h3>
<h4 id="summary-5">Summary</h4>
<p>Motivated by the potential to use citizen science data, which is
known to contain species identification errors, the authors propose a
new model which reframes the count detection model in terms of a
inhomogeneous Poisson point process (IPP). The authors demonstrate their
model by simulation, with RMSE and coverage used as measures of model
performance and assuming using an assemblage of three species with four
possible designations. Finally, the authors apply their model to
butterfly data in the US.</p>
<h4 id="model-specification-4">Model specification</h4>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(D \in \mathbb{R}^2\)</span> be the
study region. Let <span class="math inline">\(i = 1,2, \dots ,
R\)</span> index the location, with one of <span class="math inline">\(s
= 1,2, \dots, S\)</span> true individuals (I take this to mean true
species identifications of an individual) at each location. Then, define
the mean intensity of species <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>
occurence at location <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda_{is}.\)</span> Covariates can inform the
mean intensity through a GLM framework:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ln(\lambda_{is}) = \beta_{0_s} +
\beta_{1_s}^{&#39;}X.\]</span> The observed response data inform the
mean intensity through an inhomogeneous point process model. Here, the
count of species detections in the study region are realizations from a
poisson distribution with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu_s(D) =
\int_D \lambda_s dx\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> is the two dimensional volume element.
The locations of are sampled from the probability distribution with
density proportional to intensity at that location: <span
class="math inline">\(f_s(i) = \lambda_s(i)/\mu_s(D).\)</span></p>
<p>Next, define <span class="math inline">\(p_{is}\)</span> as the
probability of observing species <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>
at location <span class="math inline">\(i.\)</span> This probability is
modeled as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p_{is} = \frac{\lambda_{is}}{\sum_{s =
1}^S \lambda_{is}}.\]</span></p>
<p>Then, the realized true states are categorically distributed: <span
class="math display">\[V_i \sim Categorical(p_{is})\]</span></p>
<p>The previous distributions describe the true latent state. To model
the classification process, the authors define a rectangular (<span
class="math inline">\(S \times K\)</span> confusion matrix <span
class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\Omega}\)</span> that allows for <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> true species labels and <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> identifications, including categories
such as “unidentified woodpecker.” Conditional <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> and the verified (true) species
<span class="math inline">\(V_i,\)</span> the assigned species label is
given by <span class="math display">\[Y_i|V_i = v \sim
Categorical(\boldsymbol{\Omega}_v).\]</span></p>
<h4 id="notes-3">Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Philosophically, this strategy is different from the suite of
models described above in that it is not concerned with whether a
detection is a true or false positive, but rather simply if the species
identification is correct.</p></li>
<li><p>The explanation of the IPP was from <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/inhomogeneous-poisson-process">Science
Direct</a> and is included to jog my memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Notation is essentially the same as the latent true species label
<span class="math inline">\(k[ijl]\)</span> used by <span
class="citation" data-cites="spiers22">Spiers et al. (<a
href="#ref-spiers22" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>.
Additionally, the rectangular confusion matrix is familiar, a la <span
class="citation" data-cites="spiers22">Spiers et al. (<a
href="#ref-spiers22" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span></p></li>
<li><p>This may not be the most useful model in the context of bat
applications because it requires detection of individuals at random
locations, rather than detection and classification at fixed points
(i.e., where the detector gets deployed).</p></li>
<li><p>Unclear whether we must have verified true state for all
locations/observations or just a subset.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the true species is predicted as <span
class="math display">\[
\Gamma_{iks} = \frac{\omega_{sk}
\frac{\hat{\lambda_{is}}}{\sum_{s}\hat{\lambda_{is}}}}{\sum_{s}
\left[\omega_{sk}
\frac{\hat{\lambda_{is}}}{\sum_{s}\hat{\lambda_{is}}}\right]}
